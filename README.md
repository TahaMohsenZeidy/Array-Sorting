#  Visualisation of different sorting algorithms out there
## Array Sorting
This is a Python project that I did to see how sorting algorithms actually work, I used some basic Python libraries from matplotlib and PyQt5 such as QtCore, QtGui and QtWidgets.

## Installation
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the required libraries.

```bash
pip install PyQt5
pip install matplotlib
```

## All the needed packages

```python
from PyQt5 import QtWidgets
import sys
from PyQt5.QtGui import QPixmap
import matplotlib.animation as animation
import TableSorting
import master as srt
import random
from matplotlib.backends.backend_qt5agg import FigureCanvasQTAgg as FigureCanvas
from matplotlib.figure import Figure
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
